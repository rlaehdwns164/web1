    <h2>Deadlift</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlift" target="_blank" title="Squat"></a>
      The deadlift is a weight training exercise in which a
      loaded barbell or bar is lifted off the ground to the
      level of the hips, torso perpendicular to the floor,
      before being placed back on the ground. It is one of
      the three powerlifting exercises, along with the squat
      and bench press.
